This folder contains the implementation of the pWeb
public website at http://www.pwebproject.net, including
the web interface to the device search feature. The
following instructions tell you how to set up a local
copy of the website on Ubuntu 13.04 (Raring Ringtail).
The website has also been tested on Ubuntu 12.04 
few, if any, modifications should be necessary to the
following instructions when setting up the website
on a different version of Ubuntu or GNU/Linux operating
system.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Setting and Running up the pWeb Website Locally
on Ubuntu 13.04
-----------------------------------------------------------

Step 1: Install the required software

The pWeb website uses the Django web development framework
and django-cms. These can be installed using the following
commands. If 

$ sudo apt-get install python-setuptools
$ sudo easy_install pip
$ sudo pip install django==1.5.1 django-reversion==1.7.1 django-cms==2.4.2

Step 2: Extract website configuration

Create a directory for the website files and
extract the contents of the archive to it:

$ sudo mkdir /var/lib/django
$ sudo tar -xjf "pWeb django website - July 30 2013.tar.bz2" -C /var/lib/django/

Django comes with a "development server" that is
sufficient for running the pWeb website on a single
machine. You can start the Django development
server with the command

$ /var/lib/django/pweb/manage.py runserver

Now you should be able to go to

http://localhost:8000

in your web browser and see a copy of the pWeb
website running locally. Test the device search page
to make sure that it's working. You may not have
any entries in your database yet, but performing a search
for, say "test," should not produce any errors.

Note: The device registration link in the top menu is hardcoded
to the public registration page at http://cn109.cs.uwaterloo.ca/.
It does not link to your local registration server, so make
sure you know which pWeb network you're using!

Congratulations! You now have a working local copy of
the pWeb website. You should have already set up your
DNS Gateway and Crawler, and search database. If you haven't
set up your Home Agent and registration server, do
that next. Then you're all done!
